        a ndarray containing the weighting factor

    Returns the mean value of each metric for the whole bundle, only

    weighted by the number of streamlines crossing a voxel by default.

    Parameters
    ------------
    streamlines : sequence
        sequence of T streamlines. One streamline is an ndarray of shape
        (N, 3), where N is the number of points in that streamline, and
        ``streamlines[t][n]`` is the n-th point in the t-th streamline. Points
        are of form x, y, z in voxmm coordinates.

    metrics_files : sequence
        list of nibabel objects representing the metrics files

    density_weighting : bool
        weigh by the mean by the density of streamlines going through the voxel

    Returns
    ---------
    stats : list
        list of tuples where the first element of the tuple is the mean

        metric.
